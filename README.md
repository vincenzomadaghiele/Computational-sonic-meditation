Sonic Meditations - X
by Pauline Oliveiros

Sit in a circle with your eyes closed. Begin by observing your own breathing. Gradually form a mental image of one person who is sitting in the circle. Sing a long tone to that person. Then sing the pitch that person is singing. Change your mental image to another person and repeat until you have contacted every person in the circle one or more times.

The meditation is performed by 20 computational agents listening to each other.
